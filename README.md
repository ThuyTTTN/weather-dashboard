# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This challenge was to create a Weather Dashboard by utilizing Open Weather API. The dashboard was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Moment.js. Users can search a city and view current weather data.  A 5-day weather forecast is also provided for the city. The UV index is color coded to be green(favorable), yellow(moderate), and red(severe).
